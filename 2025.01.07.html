    Hello World!
    Start a document by creating a boilerplate code. You can do this by typing "!"
    <br><br><br>
    <h1>Title Heading:  <br>It is ideal to only have 1 H1 tag, because h1 is the title of the document itself
    </h1>
    <h2>Sub-heading. This is the second level</h2>
    <h3> Level 3 Subheading. 
        <br>The headings provide the structure of the document. It mimics the structure of a written document.
        <br>
        This is why we call it an HTML document, not an HTML file. 
    </h3>
    <h4>search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your webpages</h4>
        <p> "you have to see how it would look in a web server" 
        does that mean a typical display would not be what a web server would look like? I wonder why?</p>
<br><br><br>
    <h1>Example: Report Title</h1>
    <h2>Section 1: Introduction</h2>
    <h3>Section 1.1 Background</h3>
            <p>Content goes here. Using the structure of this page - browsers, extensions, etc can understand the page</p>
    <h2>Section 2: Purpose</h2>
    <br><br><br><br>
    <h1>What did we learn?</h1>
    <p>H1-6 can provide formatting. <br>There are other tags we can use on content to add information. </p>
    <h2>Next Up</h2>
    <p>next lets look at some text elements we can use to format. This includes strong (strong), bold (b), emphasized text (em), italics (i), and underline (u).</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Style Tags</h2>
    <p><strong>Use "strong" for this effect. It is important AND bold. Search engines and e-readers should understand that this is important.</strong></p>
    <p><b>Use "b" for this effect. It's not as important as strong, it's just bold.</b></p>
    <p><em>Use "em" for emphasize. It is important and italicised.</em></p>
    <p><i>Use "i" for italicise, its just aesthetic.</i></p>
    <p>Why are emphasize and italicize both available if they look exactly the same?</p>

    <p>underline</p>
    <h2>horizonal rule "hr" creates a dividing line.</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>we can specify how wide we want a line to be.</p>
    <hr width="300px">
    <p>above is a line which has been set to 300 pixels.</p>
    <hr width="50%">
    <p>above is a line which has been set to 50% of the width of the document.</p>
   <br><hr><br>
    <p>Even when I added a line break in text, the browser does not consider the space or create the line break.</p>
    <p>So how can we create a line break? <strong>Use "br" to create a line break</strong></p>
    <p>how can we write the code? <br> "<" and the other symbols are reserved/special characters.You can write the symbols with other text such as "&gt;" (you'll have to look at the code to see how it's written)</p>
<br><hr><br>
<h2>Writing comments in the code</h2>
    <p>You can use comments to add notes either for yourself or for other designers/developers you might be working with. To add a comment press CMD/CTRL + / </p>
    <!-- I've added a comment in the text file here. It will not display on the page. -->
    <p>Comments do not apply any formatting, spacing, or have any impact on the display.</p>
    <p>You can use comments to easily hide elements from the page when you are editing. When you are dealing with a long document, this is an easy way to hide a big element.</p>

<h2>Text Elements</h2>
    <p>The text elements below are examples of ways we can format the documents. It is generally better to format using CSS, but these are the essential elements you could use.</p>
        <body>
        <h3>Text Formatting Example</h3>
            <p>This is a <b>bold</b> text.</p>
            <p>This is a <strong>strong</strong> text.</p>
            <p>This is an <i>italicized</i> text.</p>
            <p>This is an <em>emphasized</em> text.</p>
            <p>This is an <u>underlined</u> text.</p>
            <p>This is a <strong><em>bold and italic</em></strong> text.</p>
            <p>This is a <sub>subscript</sub> and <sup>superscript</sup> text.</p>
            <p>This is <small>smaller</small> text.</p>
            <p>This is <ins>inserted</ins> text.</p>
            <p>This is a text with <del>strikethrough</del> and <ins>inserted</ins> text.</p>
            <p>This is a <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> abbreviation.</p>
            <p>This is a <mark>highlighted</mark> text.</p>
